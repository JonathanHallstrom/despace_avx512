### testing avx512 on my new processor
```string despacing times (1MB input ran 1024 times):
scalar: 1.952s           throughput: 0.55GB/s 
stdlib: 1.069s           throughput: 1.00GB/s 
avx512: 18.624ms                 throughput: 57.65GB/s 
memcpy: 15.718ms                 throughput: 68.31GB/s 
```
its pretty fast!
